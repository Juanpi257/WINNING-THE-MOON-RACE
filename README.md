WINNING THE MOON RACE WITH THE APOLLO 8

The decision to take the Apollo 8 spacecraft to the moon was hardly 
trivial. In 1967, three men had died in the Apollo 1 capsule, and multiple 
unmanned missions had blown up or otherwise failed. Against this backdrop and with so much at stake, everything hinged on the concept of the 
free return. The mission was designed so that if the service module engine 
failed to fire, the ship would simply swing around the moon and return to 
the earth like a boomerang
